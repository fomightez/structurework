=============

Repository for programs and Python scripts for molecular structure analysis.

See the sub-folders in this repository for specifics. (Sorely need to improve on this.)

----------------------------

Collection of links to launchable Jupyter environment where various structure/function analysis tools work. Many of my recent scripts are built with use in these environments in mind:

- [bio3d-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/bio3d-binder) - launchable, working Jupyter-baseed environment with bio3d package for Biological Structure Analysis running in RStudio with some examples (*RStudio???-based).

- [cl_demo-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/cl_demo-binder) - launchable, working Jupyter-baseed environment that has a collection of demonstrations useful resources on command line for manipulating structure files
