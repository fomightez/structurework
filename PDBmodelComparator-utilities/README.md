# PDBMmodelCompator-utilities

Utility scripts for working with the PDBMmodelCompator.

A set of Jupyter notebooks that include demonstrations of all these scripts is launchable in active form right in your browser is at my [PDBMmodelCompator repo](https://github.com/fomightez/PDBMmodelCompator). Just go [there](https://github.com/fomightez/pdbepisa-binder) and click the `launch binder` badge to get started.

# The scripts

* missing_residue_detailer.py
> PDB identifier code ---> information on missing residues per chain

Meant to use Python code to recapitulate what Eric Martz's FirstGlance in Jmol gives in its report on missing residues pane.  
Note that to make sure this recapitulates what Eric Martz's FirstGlance in Jmol gives, some tests are run for a few PDB files on my [PDBMmodelCompator repo](https://github.com/fomightez/PDBMmodelCompator). (This is planned to be made to be automated for any commit eventually.) To explore the tests, go [here](https://github.com/fomightez/PDBMmodelCompator), click '`launch binder`', and then open the notebook [(Technical) Jupyter Notebook testing if output of utility script `missing_residue_detailer.py` makes same content as FirstGlance in Jmol](additional_nbs/test_missing_residue_detailer.ipynb) under the 'Technical Section'. Also see [here](https://github.com/fomightez/PDBmodelComparator/tree/main/additional_nbs/tests/README.md).

This script works with browser-based computing environments powered by WebAssembly, like Pyodide / JupyterLite!

* ???????.py

#### For running in a Jupyter notebook:

To use this script after pasting or loading into a cell in a Jupyter notebook, in the next cell define the URL and then call the main function similar to below:
```
import ?????
df = ?????
```
See [here](https://github.com/fomightez/PDBMmodelCompator) for notebooks demonstrating use within a Jupyter notebook; click `launch binder` to launch a session that will allow you to use the notebooks from there.
