# PDBMmodelCompator-utilities

Utility scripts for working with the PDBMmodelCompator.

A set of Jupyter notebooks that include demonstrations of all these scripts is launchable in active form right in your browser is at my [PDBMmodelCompator repo](https://github.com/fomightez/PDBMmodelCompator). Just go [there](https://github.com/fomightez/pdbepisa-binder) and click the `launch binder` badge to get started.

Be sure to see the 'Related' section below as well.


# The scripts

* missing_residue_detailer.py
> PDB identifier code ---> information on missing residues per chain

Meant to use Python code to recapitulate what Eric Martz's FirstGlance in Jmol gives in its report on missing residues pane.
Note that to make sure this recapitulates what Eric Martz's FirstGlance in Jmol gives, some tests are run on  my [PDBMmodelCompator repo](https://github.com/fomightez/PDBMmodelCompator). (This is planned to be made to be automated for any commit eventually.)


* ???????.py
> Placeholder for example input ---> Placeholder for example result


#### For running in a Jupyter notebook:

To use this script after pasting or loading into a cell in a Jupyter notebook, in the next cell define the URL and then call the main function similar to below:
```
import ?????
df = ?????
```
See [here](https://github.com/fomightez/PDBMmodelCompator) for notebooks demonstrating use within a Jupyter notebook; click `launch binder` to launch a session that will allow you to use the notebooks from there.
