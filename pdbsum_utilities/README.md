# The scripts

* xxxxx.py
> xxxxx data --> dataframe of data for use in Python

Takes xxxx and makes a dataframe from it for use with Python.

Verified compatible with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.8.

Written to run from command line or pasted/loaded inside a Jupyter notebook cell.  
The main ways to run the script are demonstrated in xxxxxx


Example calls to run the `xxxxx.py` script from command line:
```
python xxxxx.py xxxxxxx
```

(Alternatively, upload the script to a Jupyter environment and use `%run xxxxxxx.py xxxxxx` in a Python-backed notebook to run the example.)



#### For running in a Jupyter notebook:

To use this script after pasting or loading into a cell in a Jupyter notebook, in the next cell define the URL and then call the main function similar to below:
```
df =xxxxx("xxxxx")
```
See [here](xxxxxx) for notebooks demonstrating use within a Jupyter notebook; click `launch binder` to launch a session that will allow you to use the notebooks from there.
